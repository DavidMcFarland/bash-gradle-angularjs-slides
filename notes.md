# Detour
* Audience - who is developing in Java?
- Who is using Ant?
- Who is using Maven?
- Who has head of Gradle?
- Who is using Gradle?

Quick run through of Gradle.... :)

# Intro
This is a sales pitch for Gradle - which I have no affiliation with however personally think is the best build tool for Java currently available.
First to recap on some Java build history:
Ant 

# Sales pitch: Grade
* A walk through time... ant, maven, gradle.
* Snippets from bell slide - create speech..

# Intro 'The good old days' (Make slides an AngularJS application)
* Plain old javascript dom manipulation.
* jQuery - selectors.
AngularJS:
* 2 - way bindings.
* Controllers.
* Filters
* ng-repeats
* directives (everything is a directive a input label...)
* Karma - testing.. (Doesn't integrate well with Gradle... you can write scripts to support it but it means that you don't have an encapsulated build and are dependent on the systems setup.)
* Some resources.

Watch some presentations on AngularJs.
